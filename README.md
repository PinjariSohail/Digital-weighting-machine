# Digital-weighting-machine using ESP32, HX711 load cell and 16X2 LCD display

This project demonstrates how to build and calibrate a digital weight measuring device using the ESP32 microcontroller, an HX711 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) module, a load cell, and a 16x2 LCD display. The main goal of this system is to measure the weight of different substances or objects placed on the load cell and display their weights in real-time on the LCD screen. The load cell acts as a weight sensor and produces a small analog voltage in response to the force (weight) applied. Since the output signal from the load cell is very weak and not directly compatible with the ESP32â€™s input pins, the HX711 module is used to amplify and convert this analog signal into a digital one, which can be accurately processed by the ESP32.

The ESP32 serves as the brain of the project, processing the digital weight data received from the HX711 and then sending it to the 16x2 LCD display, where it is shown in human-readable form. The system also includes a calibration routine, allowing users to precisely adjust and fine-tune the measurements to match a known weight, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This project is ideal for applications such as kitchen scales, small weighing machines, or industrial prototypes where real-time digital weight measurement is essential. It demonstrates a practical and cost-effective solution by integrating sensors, analog-to-digital conversion, and digital display technologies into one cohesive unit.
